## Web + 3D + Audio (Spotify)

An immersive 3D browser-based room. Users connect their spotify accounts to see their top played songs represented as vinyl records.
Users interact with the vinyl records to play songs.

## Important Note

Because the app is in development mode, only users that have been added manually by email can connect with the Spotify web sdk.

So if you'd like to try the app, ping me somewhere like LinkedIn.

## Spotify Developer API notes

- create an app in spotify for developers section
- set redirect URI to localhost
- client-side auth https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/code-pkce-flow
- to get web playback working, need to switch current device thru spotify app to My Dope Room
